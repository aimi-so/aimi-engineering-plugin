## Console Error Attribution

Defines `attribute_console_errors()`, called by the per-story post-merge visual verification step above. Pure orchestrator-side reasoning — no new CLI calls, no new subagents. Adds ≤ 1 turn of orchestrator inference per wave (typically far less because most stories have 0 errors).

### Inputs

- `console_json` — JSON returned by `agent-browser console --json` for this story's verification page-load. Shape: `{"data":{"messages":[{"type":"log|warning|error|info","text":"...","args":[...]}]}}`. Messages with `type == "error"` and `type == "warning"` are the only ones considered; `log` / `info` are ignored.
- `errors_json` — JSON from `agent-browser errors --json`. Uncaught exceptions and unhandled promise rejections. Shape: `{"data":{"errors":[{"message":"...","stack":"..."}]}}`.
- `wave_stories` — the wave's `succeeded_stories` array, each carrying `id`, `title`, and `implementation.files[]`.

### Procedure

1. **Merge** the `messages` (filtered to type `error`/`warning`) and `errors` arrays into a flat list of `{kind, text, stack}` records where `kind ∈ {error, warning, exception}`.
2. **Drop the noise** — ignore well-known browser/extension noise that does not indicate code defects:
   - Lines matching `/extension:|chrome-extension:|moz-extension:/`
   - Lines matching `/DevTools failed to load source map/`
   - Lines matching `/Download the React DevTools/`
   - Lines whose `text` is empty after trim
3. **For each remaining record, attribute** by trying these strategies in order; first match wins, no fallthrough:
   - **a. Stack-trace file match**: parse `stack` for tokens that look like project paths (anything matching `/[A-Za-z0-9_./-]+\.(tsx?|jsx?|vue|svelte|rb|py|go|rs|java|kt)/`). For each path token, check whether it appears in any `wave_stories[*].implementation.files[]`. First story whose `files[]` contains the token → attributed.
   - **b. Text component-name match**: when no stack-trace match, scan the `text` for `PascalCase` identifiers (`/\b[A-Z][a-zA-Z0-9]+\b/`). For each, check whether any `wave_stories[*].implementation.files[]` contains a path with that identifier as a basename component (e.g., text mentions `ContributorsCard` → match story with `…/ContributorsCard/index.tsx`). First match → attributed.
   - **c. Wave-shared**: when neither matches, attribute to the wave as a whole with reason `"shared module or ambiguous origin"`.
4. **Build the `ATTRIBUTION` object**:
   ```
   ATTRIBUTION = {
     has_errors: <bool — true when any error|exception remains after de-noising>,
     summary: <one-line string: e.g., "2 errors, 1 warning (1 attributed: US-003)"
              when this is the per-story output; or "2 errors, 1 warning, 1 wave-shared">,
     attributed: [{kind, text, story_id, attribution_method: "stack-file"|"text-component"|"wave-shared"}],
   }
   ```
5. **Per-story output** (when called from the post-merge step):
   - Filter `attributed` to entries where `story_id == full_story.id` for the `Report` line.
   - Push the full per-story attribution object into `CONSOLE_BUFFER[full_story.id]` so the wave summary can emit a consolidated view.

### Confidence and policy

- Attribution is **advisory only**. It NEVER toggles `verification.status` and NEVER triggers a cascade-skip. A failed visual story stays failed only when the screenshot does not match `verification.expect` — console errors are reported in parallel.
- When attribution method is `text-component` or `wave-shared`, the report line MUST include the word "likely" (e.g., `"likely US-004 (FooComponent ref)"`) so the user knows it is heuristic.

### Wave summary section (rendered at end of wave)

After the per-story post-merge loop finishes, if `CONSOLE_BUFFER` has any entries for the wave just completed, append to the wave summary report:

```
Console (advisory):
  - US-003: 2 errors (attributed via stack: ContributorsCard/index.tsx)
  - US-005: 1 error (likely from text match: UserProfile)
  - wave-shared: 1 warning (could not attribute to a single story)
```

This is ADDITIVE to the existing `Wave [wave] complete: ...` line — does not replace it.
