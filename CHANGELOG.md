## [Unreleased]

## [0.2.1] - 2026-02-15

### Added

- AGENTS.md update instructions in story-executor (mirrors Ralph's prompt.md pattern)
- Step 10 in execution-rules.md for updating AGENTS.md files with reusable patterns
- AGENTS.md guidance in compact prompt template

### Changed

- Execution flow now includes AGENTS.md check before committing (Step 5 in SKILL.md)

## [0.2.0] - 2026-02-15

### Security

- **BREAKING:** Add branchName validation in `/aimi:execute` to prevent command injection
- Add input sanitization for story content before prompt interpolation (prevents prompt injection)
- Restrict Bash permissions in `/aimi:next` to specific command prefixes (git, npm, bun, yarn, tsc, eslint, prettier)

### Changed

- **BREAKING:** Rename `passes` field to `completed` in tasks.json schema for clarity
- Inline story data in Task prompts (reduces file I/O by ~33%)
- Extract only Codebase Patterns from progress.md (reduces context usage)
- Add structured error format with type classification for programmatic handling

### Added

- JSON schema validation requirements in task-format.md
- Available Capabilities section in story-executor (agents know their tools)
- Compact prompt template for subsequent stories (~60% token reduction)
- Progress rotation guidelines (archive when exceeding 50KB)
- Error type classification: typecheck_failure, test_failure, lint_failure, runtime_error, dependency_missing, unknown

### Removed

- Duplicate plugin.json at root level (keep only in plugins/aimi-engineering/)

## [0.1.0] - 2026-02-15

### Added

#### Commands
- `/aimi:brainstorm` - Explore ideas through guided brainstorming (wraps compound-engineering)
- `/aimi:plan` - Create implementation plan and convert to tasks.json
- `/aimi:deepen` - Enhance plan with research and update tasks.json
- `/aimi:review` - Code review using compound-engineering workflows
- `/aimi:status` - Show current task execution progress
- `/aimi:next` - Execute the next pending story with retry logic
- `/aimi:execute` - Run all stories autonomously in a loop

#### Skills
- `plan-to-tasks` - Convert markdown implementation plans to structured tasks.json format

#### Documentation
- Task format reference with JSON schema and sizing rules
- Execution rules reference with 9-step execution flow
- Complete README with workflow guide and troubleshooting
